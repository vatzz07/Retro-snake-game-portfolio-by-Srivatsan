🕹️ Retro Snake Portfolio – Handheld Console Website

📖 Overview

Snake Portfolio is a retro handheld–style portfolio website where visitors can play the classic Snake game to unlock different sections of my work. Built with React, TypeScript, and Canvas, the project merges nostalgic design with modern frontend development.

Instead of static menus, portfolio content appears as “food” for the Snake — About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. Each section opens in a pixelated modal, styled with retro aesthetics like glitch effects, scanlines, and pixel fonts.
